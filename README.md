**Project Description**

I want to automate my process of deciding which dining hall to eat at.
A user starts by getting a list of all the food items served in the upcoming 7 days.
A user can add food items to a list of favorite foods.
The user will be given a list of dates and meal times and locations for that food item in the following week.
